# Now

Export to pdf? (Maybe just .html file that could be opened, but default editor... maybe download to an image, maybe just link to a page that can be "printed" that looks better?)
Url Params?
Download/upload file with data about matrix (seemingly best idea)
Better space out birds in the background

# Later
